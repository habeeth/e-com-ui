//Use applyMiddleware for async actions.
//use thunk for below error

//Error: Actions must be plain objects.Instead, the actual type was: 'function'.You may need to add middleware to your store setup to handle dispatching other values, such as 'redux-thunk' to handle dispatching functions.See https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#middleware and https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic#using-the-redux-thunk-middleware for examples.

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));

export default store;
